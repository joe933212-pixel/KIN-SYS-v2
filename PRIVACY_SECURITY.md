# Privacy and Security

## Privacy-Preserving Verification

In order to ensure the privacy of our users while maintaining verification processes, we implement the following techniques:

1. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: This allows for verifying data without revealing the actual data itself.
2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Enables computations on encrypted data, providing outcomes while keeping the data secure.
3. **Decentralized Identity**: Users retain control of their own identity information through decentralized frameworks.

## Security Architecture

Our security architecture is built around the principles of:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls to protect sensitive information.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data is encrypted during transit and at rest, ensuring that unauthorized parties cannot access it.
- **Regular Security Audits**: Conducting regular assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

By applying these methods, we strive to create a safe environment for all users of our system, ensuring that privacy and security are at the forefront of our design processes.
